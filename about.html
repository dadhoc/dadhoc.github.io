              So you stumbled upon my humble little bite of the web, huh? My name's Fran, and I'm many things to many people. A storyteller, a visual artist, a scholar, a bit of a jackass. To you, I'm the webmaster of this little portfolio / project.
            </br></br>
              As for the website, well, I got sick of using Google Drive and Instagram to host my art. Both those sites represent companies that, in turn, represent everything wrong with the modern web in my not-so-humble opinion. (shoutouts to google domains for the cheap URL btw lol)
            </br></br>
              This project started out with a template, but then my ADHD hit and I couldn't be bothered to read the documentation, so I did as neurodivergent does and decided to learn me some HTML / CSS instead :)
            </br>
              Besides showcasing my art, I'm not sure what the goal of this site is. Old web revival, maybe? A bit of a nostalgia trip, for sure... I dunno. I'm just having fun with it, to be honest. I hope you enjoy this place as much as I'm enjoying putting it together &hearts; 
            </br></br>
              All of the code, unless otherwise credited below, was written by me (admittedly with a lot of help, especially the foundational stuff). The same goes for all of the graphics used on the website, all painstakingly crafted in Aseprite for that genuine 98 PC feel.
            </br></br>
            </br></br>
              Below are some shoutouts to some solid folks I love very much, and credits where they are due. Most of the websites linked in this section have their own guestbooks, so go wild, tell them Dad sent ya.
