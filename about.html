              So you stumbled upon my humble little bite of the web, huh? My name's Fran, and I'm many things to many
              people. A storyteller, a visual artist, a scholar, an archer, a bit of a jackass. To you, I'm mostly the
              webmaster of this little portfolio / project.
              </br></br>
              As for the website, well, I got sick of using Google Drive and Instagram to host my art. Both those sites
              represent companies that, in turn, represent everything wrong with the modern web in my not-so-humble
              opinion. (shoutouts to google domains for the cheap URL btw lol)
              </br></br>
              This project started out with a template, but then my ADHD hit and I couldn't be bothered to read the
              documentation, so I did as neurodivergent does and decided to learn me some HTML / CSS instead :)
              </br>
              Besides showcasing my art, I'm not sure what the goal of this site is. Old web revival, maybe? A bit of a
              nostalgia trip, for sure... I dunno. I'm just having fun with it, to be honest. I hope you enjoy this
              place as much as I'm enjoying putting it together &hearts;
              </br></br>
              The code in this website, unless otherwise credited below, was written by me (admittedly with a lot of
              help, especially the foundational stuff). The same goes for all of the graphics used on the website, all
              painstakingly crafted in Aseprite for that genuine 98 PC feel.
              </br></br>
              I also have a ko-fi page set up, feel free to drop me a few quid if you feel like it. I won't lie, the money is probably gonna go towards my hobbies, but in a roundabout way, it would also help fund the website / my photography (all the overhead of those things comes from the same funds as everything else, lol). You can find it <a href="https://ko-fi.com/dadhoc" alt="ko-fi link">here</a> :)

              Below are some shoutouts to some solid folks I love very much, and credits where they are due. Most of the
              websites linked in this section have their own guestbooks, so go wild, tell them Dad sent ya.

                <h4 class="contentbuttonsheading">ANONICUS</h4>

                <p>Great lad, known him for years. Love the work he's doing on his page, he's the one in our friend circle
                  who really kicked off our drive to join the New Old Web. Currently working on a game, as I understand
                  it; I'm sure he'll tell you all about it in his blog. Make sure you check out his OCs too!</p>

                <h4 class="contentbuttonsheading">GUMMY</h4>

                <p>Where do I start with this guy? One of my oldest friends, and one of my dearest. Fancies himself a
                  streamer, and he's a pretty damn good one at that. I love the stuff he's doing on his page, too,
                  especially the daily Did You Know section. Kid wears his love for the Dreamcast on his sleeve, and I
                  respect the hell out of that. His OCs are great, too (like Anonicus, he has a whole page dedicated to
                  them! Don't tell him I said this, but Greg is still my favourite).</p>
